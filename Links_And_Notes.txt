Important Notes to be able to run the application:
- php file in the folder "phpServer", included in the files in the same submission. It must be pasted to htdocs in XAMPP folder.
- There is a library we've needed to use "mysql-connectors" installed from internet, it has been attached with project files.
- One folder named "ClientSide" for the client side & the other one named "ServerSide" for the server (Servlet part).
- When the user download an image it will be in "C:\Users\Hp".
- Images saved in "C:\Users\Hp\images" (Must create images folder here), so database stores the id, name, directory and descriptions only.
